%% Run indent/detent algorithm and place appropriate strings in place for the
%% PEG grammar to use.
%%
%% From Python:
%% Before the first line of the file is read, a single zero is pushed on the
%% stack; this will never be popped off again. The numbers pushed on the stack
%% will always be strictly increasing from bottom to top. At the beginning of
%% each logical line, the lineâ€™s indentation level is compared to the top of the
%% stack. If it is equal, nothing happens. If it is larger, it is pushed on the
%% stack, and one INDENT token is generated. If it is smaller, it must be one of
%% the numbers occurring on the stack; all numbers on the stack that are larger
%% are popped off, and for each number popped off a DEDENT token is generated. At
%% the end of the file, a DEDENT token is generated for each number remaining on
%% the stack that is larger than zero.
%%
%%
%% This module replaces the first ws of any indent with 

-module(indents).
