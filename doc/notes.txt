[ ] - Make sure that there is a locally accessable lib directory for erlang-
      set it up if necessary and store any environment variables etc. needed
      (similar to haxe for haxelib setup - which drops the location in
      ~/.haxelib)

[ ] - Easy scripts for all release-management / application stuff

[ ] - Run in such a way that upgrades / hot code swapping works correctly
      (embedded system, using heart, etc.)

ERL_LIBS can hold all the library directories (see http://medevyoujane.com/blog/2008/11/13/adding-erlang-library-locations.html )


[ ] - Something similar to cean.process-one.net or erlware.org, but make it
      very easy to simply install something from github etc.- that is, simply
      have one "erlapp.xml" file or something that explains everything else
      needed.


[ ] - Auto handle .erl, .ifn, .efn, and .fn (and in the future some of the lisp
      variants as well?


[ ] - Some replacement for term files that's more ifn-ish, or with even fewer
      commas- so more s-expression-ish















=== Erlang ===

- Fewer ".", ";", ",", and "end"
- Tuples with parens
- Easier fun syntax
- Comments / Comment initiator
- "Struct"

- Proper inheritance (parent's calls look at child first)
- spread out different patterns for the same function
- don't have to use ';' between function defs (vs . if arity is different)
- export fun-name without arity assumes all arity

- better namespaces

- DNRY!  (Do Not Repeat Yourself)
