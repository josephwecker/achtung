Errors / Warnings
 - ungbarc level - can't open files, create directories, etc.
 - Neotoma parser can't find a way through
 - Semantic issues- like multiple module definitions: Erlang-based
 - Semantic issues that are only Ungbar related
 - Erlang warnings (like terms that are created but not used
 - Erlang-ish but enhanced: e.g., No functions were exported
 - Possibly lower-level errors during parsing that would need to get handled
   better (don't have examples at the moment)


------------------- Temporarily Skipped --------
[ ] - Escaped newlines and super-indents
[ ] - Questionmarks in atoms (implemented but not tested)
[ ] - Implicit exports
[ ] - Package attribute
[ ] - Parameters attribute
[ ] - Implicit (or easy explicit- not using compile) inlines
[ ] - Behavior attribute special functionality
[ ] - "Ditto" clause:
      |first  -|
      |second -> same_atom

------------------- Minor -----------------------
[ ] - Syntax highlighting for "official" module attributes
[ ] - Probably better allow blocks after = or :=
