Whitespace deliniated lists
Dangling commas in lists
"Built-in" regular expressions
String interpolation

Shortcut guard expressions
  - allow '?' at end of function defs
  - is_list()  -> l?() etc.
  - some_fun|Blah:atom, etc
Take any spec/type or combo and turn it into a (possibly deeply nested) guard
sequence?


Shortcuts for type conversion functions


Syntax for function parameter defaults?
More common use of packages?


Expression ->
  Term -> Data (Number, Atom, List, Tuple, ...)
  Variables -> Hold a term value (after bound)
  Pattern -> like Term but with unbound variables
  Match -> Assignment with pattern matching.  Pattern = Term
