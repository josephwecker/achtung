= Step 1 - Validate t()'s, inline t()'s and c()'s

. Create generic `t()` (transformation function) if none present
. Verify positions for positional arguments
. Verify labels/rule-names for named arguments
. Attach `c()` (collapse functions) to the final terms of all tagged terms
  (including whole body term for `$_`)
. Attach `t()` to all 'tail' terms (recursively as follows):
.. If body is atomic, attach `t()` to that term.
.. If body is a `seq`, attach `t()` to final terms of final term in `seq`.
.. If body is an `opt`, attach `t()` to final terms of every 

.Final Term(s)
****
Given:: Expression `e` (initially the `body`)

. If `e` is atomic, `e` is a final term.
. If `e` is a `seq`, find final term(s) of last `term` in the `seq`.

= Step 2 - Transform to Normal 1

. All `lits` turned into `seq(char)`
. All `
