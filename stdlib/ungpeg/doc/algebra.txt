=== Reduced Form ===
 * Everything inlined except for recursive calls, entry-points, and accumulators
 * All prefix (predicate) attributes and suffix attributes reduced (see below)
 * No '+' accumulators- only '*' accumulators

= Ordered Priority Sequence (ord) =
 * Contains no ords (sucked inline)  # TODO: what attributes on an inner ord would overrule this?
 * Contains no opts (all changed to inline term/empty) # TODO: ditto
 * Contains nothing after any 'star' term (which will always succeed)
 * Contains nothing after 'empty' (removed w/ warning)
 * Contains at least two terms (if empty internal-error, if 1 child, replaces parent)
 * Tags allowed on any/all children and on whole
 * Transforms allowed on any/all children and on whole
 * All inner terms reduced
 * 

= Predicated Ordered Priority Sequence (!/& ord) =



= Sequence (seq) =
 * Any andp predicates preceding an ord
