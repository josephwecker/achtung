[ ] Opt backtracking/memoizing elimination
[ ] Multi backtracking/memoization elimination
[ ] Predicate backtracking/memoization elimination
[ ] Parse transforms and aggregation
[ ] Left recursion

--- Detailed
[ ] Some way to get rid of redundant bs_test_unit calls in opcodes?
[ ] Detect bad character ranges (ranges in the wrong order)
[ ] Fix it so it correctly discovers all entrypoints again
[ ] Ungpeg warning/error/info/debug mechanisms (inc. flags & macros)
[ ] Beginning of format_error function
[ ] Redo specials as succ/fail
[ ] Attribute and basic list normalization
[ ] Pure inlined recursive at first- pull out additional entrypoints after all
    the transformations- or mark the call as recurse, to simplify
    left-recursion algorithm.  (the latter, so that distinct grammars can be
    combined and it'll work correctly - that is, entry points to expressions
    that don't overlap with other entry points' instructions).
[ ] Figure out panic-mode (skip ahead) error recovery

--- Finished
[D] Fix unicode / wide character consumption / comparing & byte_size in
    compiler writer.
[D] Input line-numbers in parse tree
[D] Left recursion algorithm decided on etc.

[D] Fix ungpeg_n so that it's ok with 'Blah' styled names
[D] Syn highlight for proposed parse-transform stuff
[D] Change parser etc. so that new entry-point marker is ':'
[D] Change parser etc. so that it allows optional rule delimiter ';'
[D] Capture transformation phrases
[D] Ability to tag items
[D] In transformer, swap out "orig" for all relevant tags before inlining
