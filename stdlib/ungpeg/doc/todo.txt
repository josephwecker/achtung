[ ] Pure inlined recursive at first- pull out additional entrypoints after all
    the transformations- or mark the call as recurse, to simplify
    left-recursion algorithm.  (the latter, so that distinct grammars can be
    combined and it'll work correctly - that is, entry points to expressions
    that don't overlap with other entry points' instructions).
[ ] Fix ungpeg_n so that it's ok with 'Blah' styled names

[D] Syn highlight for proposed parse-transform stuff
[D] Change parser etc. so that new entry-point marker is ':'
[D] Change parser etc. so that it allows optional rule delimiter ';'
[D] Capture transformation phrases
[D] Ability to tag items
[D] In transformer, swap out "orig" for all relevant tags before inlining
