# The always greedy nature of the PEG doesn't allow such a construct. Which
# also means that if you can write a CFG that accepts such a construct it would
# narrow PEGs to something less powerful (in some instances). On the other
# hand, if they can't be constructed, can it be shown that there is a
# non-exponential NFA-DFA reduction possible? Finally, is there an undiscovered
# way to get exponential DFA complexity with a PEG that I just haven't
# realized?
