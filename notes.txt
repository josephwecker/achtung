- Fewer ".", ";", ",", and "end"
- Tuples with parens
- Easier fun syntax
- Comments / Comment initiator
- "Struct"

- Proper inheritance (parent's calls look at child first)
- spread out different patterns for the same function
- don't have to use ';' between function defs (vs . if arity is different)
- export fun-name without arity assumes all arity

- better namespaces

- DNRY!  (Do Not Repeat Yourself)
