Achtung Language: An alternate Erlang syntax that tries to be a natural
extension and simplification of Erlang rather than a repurposing of the VM.
Inspired by http://marianoguerra.com.ar/efene/ (highly recommended), but with
my own biased asthetics, and currently with a lot of PEG research thrown in the
mix.
